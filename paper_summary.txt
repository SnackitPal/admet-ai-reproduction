The prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) is a crucial step in drug discovery. Here, we develop ADMET-AI, a machine learning platform for fast and accurate ADMET prediction. ADMET-AI consists of an ensemble of 30 machine learning models for ADMET properties from the Therapeutics Data Commons, including HIA, Caco-2, P-gp, BBB, CYP metabolism, hERG, hepatotoxicity, and Ames mutagenicity. These models are built using a graph neural network, Chemprop, along with RDKit chemical descriptors. ADMET-AI achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TDC ADMET benchmark suite and can predict ADMET properties for over one million molecules in âˆ¼3 h. The platform also includes a module for identifying and flagging out-of-distribution molecules for which the models may make unreliable predictions. Finally, we provide a user-friendly command-line interface and web server.
